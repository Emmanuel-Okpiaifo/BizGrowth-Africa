			"The policy tweak is designed to free up liquidity for on-lending to MSMEs amid tight credit conditions.",
		body: [
			"The Central Bank of Nigeria has adjusted its cash reserve ratio guidance to encourage banks to extend more credit to the real sector, with a particular emphasis on MSMEs. The move follows months of tight liquidity that constrained working capital for small firms across manufacturing, retail, and services.",
			"While details of implementation will vary by institution, banks that meet specific MSME lending thresholds may receive relief on reserve requirements. Industry players say this could reduce borrowing costs and improve access to finance for businesses that struggled to secure affordable credit in 2025.",
			"Preliminary banking channel checks suggest a potential 100–200 bps reduction in effective borrowing costs for targeted SME facilities if reserve relief is fully passed through. Even a 5–8% lift in approved limits could close short-term cash gaps for inventory and payroll.",
			"BizGrowth Africa analysis indicates that policy credibility and consistent monitoring will be critical to ensure funds flow to MSMEs rather than large corporates. The initiative aligns with broader efforts to deepen inclusion and catalyze job growth across Nigeria’s SME ecosystem."
